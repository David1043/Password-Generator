'ALPHABET' CLASS:-

->Purpose: This class represents a pool of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) that can be used to generate passwords.
->Fields:
UPPERCASE_LETTERS, LOWERCASE_LETTERS, NUMBERS, SYMBOLS: Constants representing different character sets.
->pool: A StringBuilder that accumulates selected character sets based on user preferences.
_>Constructor: Initializes the pool based on user preferences (uppercaseIncluded, lowercaseIncluded, numbersIncluded, specialCharactersIncluded).
->Method:
getAlphabet(): Returns the combined character pool as a string.


'PASSWORD' CLASS:-

->Purpose: Represents a password with methods to calculate its strength score based on various criteria.
->Fields:
->value: Stores the actual password string.
->Constructor:
->Password(String s): Initializes the password with the provided string s.
->Methods:
->calculateScore(): Evaluates the password's strength based on:
Presence of uppercase letters.
Presence of lowercase letters.
Presence of digits.
Presence of symbols.
Length of the password.
->toString(): Overrides Object's toString() method to return the password string.


'GENERATOR' CLASS:-

->Purpose: Manages user interaction, password generation, and strength checking functionalities.
->Fields:
->alphabet: Instance of Alphabet class used for character pool.
->keyboard: Static Scanner instance for user input.
->Constructor: Initializes the alphabet instance based on user preferences.
->Methods:
->mainLoop(): Main program loop that displays a menu and handles user commands until termination.
->generatePassword(int length): Generates a password of specified length using characters from alphabet.
->printUsefulInfo(): Prints tips on password security.
->requestPassword(): Prompts user for password preferences and generates a password accordingly.
->isInclude(String input): Checks if user input is affirmative (yes).
->passwordRequestError(String input): Displays error message for invalid user input.
->checkPassword(): Checks the strength of a user-entered password.
->printMenu(): Displays the main menu options.
->printQuitMessage(): Displays a closing message and terminates the program.
->main(String[] args): Main entry point to start the program.


SUMMARY:-

->Functionality: The application allows users to generate passwords based on selected criteria (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and check the strength of passwords they input.
->User Interaction: Uses Scanner for input, displays menus and prompts for user preferences.
->Password Strength: Calculates password strength based on length and presence of different character types.
->Security Tips: Provides useful information on password security practices.
This code provides a basic implementation for a password generator and checker, suitable for learning and simple applications but may need enhancements for production-level use (e.g., handling more complex password policies, secure input handling).
